A streak counter for the browser, inspired by Duolingo

# `@jamesthemullet/streak-counter` - a basic streak counter

This is a basic streak counter - inspired by Duolingo - written in TypeScript and meant for the browser (uses `localStorage`).

Future employer - don't get too excited, this is from a course I was doing (mostly) to learn how to publish to npm.

## Install

```shell
yarn add @jamesthemullet/streak-counter
